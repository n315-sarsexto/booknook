The BookNook project is a culmination of several important elements that are essential for web development. Through the use of MVC, it allows navigation through the URL without ever actually "changing" the page, allowing a consistent, static navigation and footer throughout all pages. It also is responsive in desktop, tablet, and phone medias. As a dynamic site, many elements are to be considered, such as consistency, and naming conventions. This project also takes advantage of SASS, making the CSS and styling of the page much easier.

Following a given design, this site also simulates functions such as a sign-in, adding and removing items from a cart, and features that otherwise might be locked behind the user being signed in. All of this is being done through the use of variables in the browser, so while there is no actual interaction with a database, it is a good starter for those who have not done such before.

This project also relied upon collaboration between two team-mates. However, due to communication issues, this portion of the project ultimately fell through.
